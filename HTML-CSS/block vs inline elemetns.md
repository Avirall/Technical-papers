# Block vs. Inline Elements

## Block-Level Elements

Block-level elements are those that create a new "block" or "box" in the document layout. They typically start on a new line and occupy the full width of their containing element. Some common block-level elements include:

- `<div>`: A generic container used for structuring and organizing content.
- `<p>`: Used for creating paragraphs of text.
- `Headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)`: Used for defining section headings.
- `Lists (<ul>, <ol>)`: Used for creating lists with list items (<li>).
- `<section>, <article>, <nav>, <footer>`: Semantic block-level elements for structuring content in HTML5.
Block-level elements are often used to create the main structure of a web page.

## Inline Elements

Inline elements, on the other hand, do not create new blocks in the layout. They flow within the content, typically appearing on the same line as the surrounding text or elements. Some common inline elements include:

- `<span>`: A generic inline container often used for applying styles or manipulating specific parts of text.
- `<a>`: Used for creating hyperlinks within text.
- `<strong> and <em>`: Used for emphasizing text with bold and italic styles, respectively.
- `<img>`: Used for displaying images within text.
-`<br>`: Used for line breaks within text.
- `<code>`: Used for inline code or code snippets.
Inline elements are often used to apply formatting and styling to specific parts of text within a block-level context.
