## CSS Responsive Queries

CSS responsive queries allow you to apply different CSS styles to your website depending on the device or browser that is being used to view the site. This is useful for creating websites that look good and function well on all devices, from large desktop computers to small smartphones.

To use CSS responsive queries, you use the `@media` rule. The `@media` rule allows you to specify a condition that must be met in order for the CSS styles to be applied. For example, the following `@media` rule will apply the CSS styles to all screens that are wider than 768 pixels:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}
```

You can also use CSS responsive queries to specify other conditions, such as the device type, the screen orientation, and the color depth. For example, the following `@media` rule will apply the CSS styles to all devices that are running the iOS operating system:

```css
@media handheld and (device-width: 375px) {
  body {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

CSS responsive queries are a powerful tool for creating websites that look good and function well on all devices. By using CSS responsive queries, you can create a single website that will work for all of your users, regardless of the device they are using.

### Tips for using CSS responsive queries:

* Use the `@media` rule to specify different CSS styles for different devices and screen sizes.
* Use CSS media queries to create a single website that will work for all of your users, regardless of the device they are using.
* Use progressive enhancement to ensure that your website works for all users, even if they are using older browsers or devices that do not support CSS media queries.
