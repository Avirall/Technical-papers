# Database Isolation Levels

Database isolation levels are a critical aspect of managing transactions in a multi-user database environment. They define the degree to which one transaction's changes are visible to other concurrent transactions. Different isolation levels provide a trade-off between data consistency and performance.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Isolation Levels
- Isolation levels define the behavior of concurrent transactions concerning visibility and locking.
- There are four standard isolation levels defined by the SQL standard: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable.

### 2. ACID Properties
- Isolation is one of the ACID properties, which ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

### 3. Locking and Visibility
- Isolation levels determine how locks are acquired and released and when changes made by one transaction become visible to others.

## Standard Isolation Levels

### 1. Read Uncommitted
- In this level, transactions can read data that is currently being modified by other transactions.
- It offers the least data consistency and is prone to dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.

### 2. Read Committed
- In Read Committed, transactions can only read committed data, not uncommitted changes from other transactions.
- It eliminates dirty reads but may still have non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

### 3. Repeatable Read
- Repeatable Read prevents other transactions from modifying or inserting new data while a transaction is in progress.
- It eliminates dirty and non-repeatable reads but can still experience phantom reads.

### 4. Serializable
- Serializable provides the highest level of isolation by ensuring that no concurrent transactions can modify or insert data that would affect the current transaction.
- It eliminates all concurrency-related anomalies.

## Practical Examples

### Setting Isolation Level in SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Committed
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Begin a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Perform operations within the transaction
-- ...

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
