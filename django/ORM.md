**Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**

Django's ORM is a powerful feature that allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries. It provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for managing database models and executing queries.

**Using ORM Queries in Django Shell:**

The Django shell is an interactive Python shell with the Django environment loaded. It's a great place to test and experiment with ORM queries. To access the Django shell, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

Once in the shell, you can start executing ORM queries. Here's a basic example using a Django model:

```python
# Assuming you have a model named 'Person'
from myapp.models import Person

# Retrieve all persons
persons = Person.objects.all()

# Filter persons based on a condition
young_people = Person.objects.filter(age__lt=30)

# Get a single person by ID
person = Person.objects.get(id=1)

# Create a new person
new_person = Person.objects.create(name='John Doe', age=25)
```

This is just a basic overview. Django's ORM supports a wide range of queries, including filtering, ordering, aggregating, and more.

**Turning ORM to SQL in Django Shell:**

Django provides a way to see the SQL queries generated by ORM queries. You can enable SQL query logging in the Django shell as follows:

```python
# Enable SQL query logging
from django.db import connection
connection.queries = []

# Run your ORM queries
persons = Person.objects.all()

# Print the SQL queries
for query in connection.queries:
    print(query['sql'])
```

By examining the printed SQL queries, you can gain insights into the actual database operations being performed by your Django ORM queries.
