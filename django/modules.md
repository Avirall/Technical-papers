**1. `on_delete=CASCADE` in Django:**

In Django models, when you define a ForeignKey field, you often specify the `on_delete` parameter. This parameter determines what happens when the referenced object (the one pointed to by the foreign key) is deleted. `on_delete=CASCADE` means that when the referenced object is deleted, also delete the objects that have a foreign key pointing to it.

For example:
```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

In this case, if an `Author` is deleted, all associated `Book` objects with that author will also be deleted.

**2. Fields and Validators in Django:**

- **Fields:** Fields in Django models define the type of data that can be stored in a database column. Examples include `CharField` for character data, `IntegerField` for integers, and `DateTimeField` for date and time information.

  ```python
  class MyModel(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      age = models.IntegerField()
      created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
  ```

- **Validators:** Validators in Django are used to ensure that the data entered into a model field meets certain criteria. They can be applied to individual fields or to the model as a whole.

  ```python
  from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator, MaxValueValidator

  class MyModel(models.Model):
      age = models.IntegerField(
          validators=[MinValueValidator(0), MaxValueValidator(150)]
      )
  ```

**3. Python Module vs. Python Class:**

- **Python Module:**
  - A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
  - It can define functions, variables, and classes, among other things.
  - Modules allow code organization and reuse.
  - Example: If you have a file named `my_module.py`, it is a Python module.

    ```python
    # my_module.py
    def my_function():
        print("Hello from my function!")

    my_variable = 42
    ```

- **Python Class:**
  - A Python class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them in the form of methods.
  - Classes provide a way to structure and bundle data and functionality.
  - Example: Define a simple class named `Person` with attributes and methods.

    ```python
    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def say_hello(self):
            print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")
    ```
